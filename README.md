# Image Captioning

This project implements an Image Captioning model using deep learning techniques. The model processes images and generates descriptive captions by leveraging a CNN for feature extraction and an RNN for sequence generation.

## Features
- Feature extraction using a pre-trained **Xception** model
- Text processing with **Word2Vec** embeddings
- Sequence generation using an RNN-based architecture (LSTM/GRU)
- Image preprocessing with OpenCV
- Model training using **Keras**

## Requirements
Install the required dependencies before running the notebook:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python gensim
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageCaptioning.git
cd ImageCaptioning
```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook ImageCaptioning.ipynb
```
3. Ensure the dataset and pre-trained model weights are correctly placed.
4. Follow the notebook instructions to preprocess images, train the model, and generate captions.

## Dataset
- The project requires an image dataset (e.g., MS COCO, Flickr8k, or Flickr30k)
- Modify the notebook to specify the dataset location if needed.

## Results
- The trained model generates captions for input images.
- Evaluate the model performance using BLEU scores or other NLP metrics.

## Contributing
Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve this project.
